Warning
========
* The assumption is you will have the internet for these files to work. Granted I don't always have the internet so you might need to download the individual files by US County from http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/
* In the case of Government Shutdown these links will not work (which is so unbelievably stupid I hate even typing that). 


I just want to tell you Good Luck. We're All counting on you!
